## Part 1.1: App Description

My app is a dictionary app that displays different charactertistics (definition, phonetics, etc) and also defines the part of speech of the chosen word.
The first call to the Free Dictionary API is used for the word's characteristics.
The second call to the Meriam Webster API takes the part of speech result from the first call, and searches for its defintion.

## Part 1.2: APIs

> For each RESTful JSON API that your app uses (at least two are required),
> include an example URL for a typical request made by your app. If you
> need to include additional notes (e.g., regarding API keys or rate
> limits), then you can do that below the URL/URI. Placeholders for this
> information are provided below. If your app uses more than two RESTful
> JSON APIs, then include them with similar formatting.

### API 1 - Free Dictionary

```
https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/word

```

> Replace this line with notes (if needed) or remove it (if not needed).

### API 2 - Meriam Webster

```
https://www.dictionaryapi.com/api/v3/references/collegiate/json/word?key=afb042e4-8d41-45aa-a86b-ce1fc8eb45f3

This link requires an API key (afb042e4-8d41-45aa-a86b-ce1fc8eb45f3) and has a query limit of 1000 per day.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?
I finally learned how to breakdown the elements of a json String into multiple classes to be parsed. It is exciting to know how much I can do with that ability moving forward.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?
I would probably come up with something more creative, however with finals week and the hecticness of closing out the school year I was not able to think too hard about my options. If I could choose my own APIs (not on this list), I would do that as well.
